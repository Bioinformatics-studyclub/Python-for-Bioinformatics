# Session 2: Reading and Writing Files

In this study group we read through the appropriate chapter **(Chapter 3)** in the **Python for Biologist book.** 

We then congregate to discuss how we fared in the exercises at the end of the chapter. 

Thereafter we go through some additional Theory and Exercises if time permits.

**Launch the Interactive Jupyter notebook** ***HERE ->:*** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Bioinformatics-studyclub/Session_2_Reading-and-Writing-Files/main?filepath=Reading_and_Writing_Files.ipynb) (this takes a while to load in your browser, so please be patient)

INSTRUCTIONS:

In order for the interactive notebook above to run all the blocks without errors:
1. you need to make sure that the files that are used, are stored in the appropriate directories. 
2. So save a copy of the **dna.txt**, **genomic_dna.txt** and the **input.txt** files on your personal Desktop. 
3. Also change the file path to your OWN file path wherever you see a file path for "tracey"
E.g. /home/Cathy_Jones/Desktop, in every block where this file is supposed to run.

  1. Find the link to the book from which we do most of our exercises [HERE](https://ia800602.us.archive.org/18/items/PythonForBiologists./Python%20for%20Biologists..pdf)
