# Session 2: Reading and Writing Files

In this study group we read through the appropriate chapter **(Chapter 3)** in the **Python for Biologist book.** 

We then congregate to discuss how we fared in the exercises at the end of the chapter. 

Thereafter we go through some additional Theory and Exercises if time permits.
